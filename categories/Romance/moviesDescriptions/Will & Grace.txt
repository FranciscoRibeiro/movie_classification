Will and Grace are best friends. Will is a gay lawyer and Grace is a straight interior designer. They both live in New York City. Grace is engaged to a real jerk, but when that relationship falls apart, she moves in with Will. This is only supposed to be until Grace finds a place of her own, but she and Will end up with each other as permanent roommates. Also in the cast are Jack, Will's flamboyant gay friend, and Karen, Grace's secretary and assistant, who doesn't really need to work because she married money several times.
