Life is about to change in a big way for 16-year-old Tori Vega. After years of living in her older sister's shadow, Tori has been invited to attend Hollywood Arts, a high school with a focus on the performing arts. While the invitation came as a surprise -- she's never thought of herself as particularly talented -- and she still has to deal with being the new kid on campus, Hollywood Arts may just give Tori her chance to shine.
