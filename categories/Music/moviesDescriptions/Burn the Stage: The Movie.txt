The Movie extends the YouTube Red docuseries of the same name, which was released in March. Along with a behind-the-scenes take on the 2017 BTS Live Trilogy Episode III: The Wings Tour that builds off of what was originally featured in the webseries, the feature-length film will also include brand new interviews.
